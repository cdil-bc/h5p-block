# H5P.com Block
A block for embedding H5P content hosted on H5P.com. 

## Rationale

The official [H5P plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/h5p/) enables embedding content that has been uploaded into a Wordpress site, but it support directly embedding content hosted on H5P.com. 

This plugin creates a block for embedding content in situations where an average user is not allowed to embed iframed content, as in a multisite environment. 

## Usage
Users can add a url and the block will embed the iframe in the background.
